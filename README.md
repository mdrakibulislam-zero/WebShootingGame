## What Have I Done:
I've made this shooting game using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I've used the CDN of tailwindcss-2.2.19 from CDNJS for building custom user interfaces. I've also used gsap-3.5.1.js for animations of this game.

A content delivery network (CDN) refers to a geographically distributed group of servers which work together to provide fast delivery of Internet content.

Tailwind CSS is basically a utility first CSS framework for rapidly building custom user interfaces. It is a highly customizable, low-level CSS framework that gives you all of the building blocks you need to build bespoke designs without any annoying opinionated styles you have to fight to override.

The GreenSock Animation Platform (GSAP) is a popular set of JavaScript tools for building animations on the web. Anything you see in your web browser can be animated with GSAP. You simply write short snippets of JavaScript code that define how elements should animate and what the timing should be.
